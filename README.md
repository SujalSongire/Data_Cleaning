# NYC Airbnb Listings Data Cleaning & Visualization

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on **cleaning and visualizing NYC Airbnb listings data**. The dataset contains various details about Airbnb properties, including their locations, prices, and availability. The goal is to:
- **Clean the data** by handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
- **Visualize the listings** on a New York City map using Python.

## 🗂 Dataset
- **AB_NYC_2019.csv**: Contains Airbnb listing details.
- **New_York_City.png**: A map of New York City for plotting.

## 🔧 Steps Followed
### 1️⃣ Data Cleaning
- Checked for missing values and imputed or removed them.
- Identified and removed duplicate records.
- Standardized formats for better consistency.
- Detected and handled outliers in the dataset.

### 2️⃣ Data Visualization
- Loaded the NYC map image.
- Plotted Airbnb listings using latitude and longitude.
- Used **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** to create an informative scatter plot.

## 📊 Technologies Used
- **Python** 🐍
- **Pandas** (Data manipulation)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (Visualization)
- **Pillow (PIL)** (Image handling)

## 📌 Final Output
The final output is a **scatter plot** of Airbnb listings overlaid on a NYC map. This visualization helps understand the distribution of Airbnb properties across the city.

## 🚀 How to Run the Project
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn pillow
   ```
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook.
3. Ensure the dataset and NYC map image are in the same directory.
4. View the plotted map showing Airbnb listings.

## 🏆 Key Takeaways
- **Data cleaning is crucial** for accurate insights.
- **Visualizations help uncover patterns** in large datasets.
- **Location-based analysis** is useful for real estate and business strategies.

📌 **Future Enhancements:**
- Analyze pricing trends based on location.
- Implement clustering to segment Airbnb listings.
